        "\n# Permutation Importance vs Random Forest Feature Importance (MDI)\n\nIn this example, we will compare the impurity-based feature importance of\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` with the\npermutation importance on the titanic dataset using\n:func:`~sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance`. We will show that the\nimpurity-based feature importance can inflate the importance of numerical\nfeatures.\n\nFurthermore, the impurity-based feature importance of random forests suffers\nfrom being computed on statistics derived from the training dataset: the\nimportances can be high even for features that are not predictive of the target\nvariable, as long as the model has the capacity to use them to overfit.\n\nThis example shows how to use Permutation Importances as an alternative that\ncan mitigate those limitations.\n\n.. topic:: References:\n\n   [1] L.
