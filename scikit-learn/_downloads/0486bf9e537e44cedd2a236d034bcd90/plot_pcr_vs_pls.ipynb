        "\n# Principal Component Regression vs Partial Least Squares Regression\n\nThis example compares [Principal Component Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_regression) (PCR) and\n[Partial Least Squares Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression) (PLS) on a\ntoy dataset. Our goal is to illustrate how PLS can outperform PCR when the\ntarget is strongly correlated with some directions in the data that have a\nlow variance.\n\nPCR is a regressor composed of two steps: first,\n:class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA` is applied to the training data, possibly\nperforming dimensionality reduction; then, a regressor (e.g. a linear\nregressor) is trained on the transformed samples. In\n:class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA`, the transformation is purely\nunsupervised, meaning that no information about the targets is used. As a\nresult, PCR may perform poorly in some datasets where the target is strongly\ncorrelated with *directions* that have low variance. Indeed, the\ndimensionality reduction of PCA projects the data into a lower dimensional\nspace where the variance of the projected data is greedily maximized along\neach axis. Despite them having the most predictive power on the target, the\ndirections with a lower variance will be dropped, and the final regressor\nwill not be able to leverage them.\n\nPLS is both a transformer and a regressor, and it is quite similar to PCR: it\nalso applies a dimensionality reduction to the samples before applying a\nlinear regressor to the transformed data. The main difference with PCR is\nthat the PLS transformation is supervised. Therefore, as we will see in this\nexample, it does not suffer from the issue we just mentioned.\n"
