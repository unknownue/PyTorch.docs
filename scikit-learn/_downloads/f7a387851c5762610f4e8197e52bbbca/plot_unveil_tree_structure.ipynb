        "## Tree structure\n\nThe decision classifier has an attribute called ``tree_`` which allows access\nto low level attributes such as ``node_count``, the total number of nodes,\nand ``max_depth``, the maximal depth of the tree. The\n``tree_.compute_node_depths()`` method computes the depth of each node in the\ntree. `tree_` also stores the entire binary tree structure, represented as a\nnumber of parallel arrays. The i-th element of each array holds information\nabout the node ``i``. Node 0 is the tree's root. Some of the arrays only\napply to either leaves or split nodes. In this case the values of the nodes\nof the other type is arbitrary. For example, the arrays ``feature`` and\n``threshold`` only apply to split nodes. The values for leaf nodes in these\narrays are therefore arbitrary.\n\nAmong these arrays, we have:\n\n  - ``children_left[i]``: id of the left child of node ``i`` or -1 if leaf\n    node\n  - ``children_right[i]``: id of the right child of node ``i`` or -1 if leaf\n    node\n  - ``feature[i]``: feature used for splitting node ``i``\n  - ``threshold[i]``: threshold value at node ``i``\n  - ``n_node_samples[i]``: the number of training samples reaching node\n    ``i``\n  - ``impurity[i]``: the impurity at node ``i``\n  - ``weighted_n_node_samples[i]``: the weighted number of training samples\n    reaching node ``i``\n  - ``value[i, j, k]``: the summary of the training samples that reached node i for\n    class j and output k.\n\nUsing the arrays, we can traverse the tree structure to compute various\nproperties. Below, we will compute the depth of each node and whether or not\nit is a leaf.\n\n"

Each node has a ``value``\narray which is the number of weighted samples reaching this\nnode for each output and class.\n\nFor example, in the above tree built on the iris dataset, the root node has\n``value = [37, 34, 41]``, indicating there are 37 samples\nof class 0, 34 samples of class 1, and 41 samples of class 2 at the root node.\nTraversing the tree, the samples are split and as a result, the ``value`` array\nreaching each node changes. The left child of the root node has ``value = [37, 0, 0]``\nbecause all 37 samples in the left child node are from class 0.\n\nNote: In this example, `n_outputs=1`, but the tree classifier can also handle\nmulti-output problems.
