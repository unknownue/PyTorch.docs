We can expect similar artifacts at the end of each week or each year.\n\n- As expected, the **trigonometric features** (sine and cosine) do not have\n  these discontinuities at midnight, but the linear regression model fails to\n  leverage those features to properly model intra-day variations.\n  Using trigonometric features for higher harmonics or additional\n  trigonometric features for the natural period with different phases could\n  potentially fix this problem.\n\n- the **periodic spline-based features** fix those two problems at once: they\n  give more expressivity to the linear model by making it possible to focus\n  on specific hours thanks to the use of 12 splines. Furthermore the\n  `extrapolation=\"periodic\"` option enforces a smooth representation between\n  `hour=23` and `hour=0`.\n\n- The **one-hot encoded features** behave similarly to the periodic\n  spline-based features but are more spiky: for instance they can better\n  model the morning peak during the week days since this peak lasts shorter\n  than an hour.

        "This visualization confirms the conclusions we draw on the previous plot.\n\nAll models under-estimate the high demand events (working day rush hours),\nbut gradient boosting a bit less so. The low demand events are well predicted\non average by gradient boosting while the one-hot polynomial regression\npipeline seems to systematically over-estimate demand in that regime. Overall\nthe predictions of the gradient boosted trees are closer to the diagonal than\nfor the kernel models.\n\n## Concluding remarks\n\nWe note that we could have obtained slightly better results for kernel models\nby using more components (higher rank kernel approximation) at the cost of\nlonger fit and prediction durations. For large values of `n_components`, the\nperformance of the one-hot encoded features would even match the spline\nfeatures.\n\nThe `Nystroem` + `RidgeCV` regressor could also have been replaced by\n:class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` with one or two hidden layers\nand we would have obtained quite similar results.\n\nThe dataset we used in this case study is sampled on a hourly basis. However\ncyclic spline-based features could model time-within-day or time-within-week\nvery efficiently with finer-grained time resolutions (for instance with\nmeasurements taken every minute instead of every hours) without introducing\nmore features. One-hot encoding time representations would not offer this\nflexibility.\n\nFinally, in this notebook we used `RidgeCV` because it is very efficient from\na computational point of view. However, it models the target variable as a\nGaussian random variable with constant variance. For positive regression\nproblems, it is likely that using a Poisson or Gamma distribution would make\nmore sense. This could be achieved by using\n`GridSearchCV(TweedieRegressor(power=2), param_grid({\"alpha\": alphas}))`\ninstead of `RidgeCV`.\n\n"
