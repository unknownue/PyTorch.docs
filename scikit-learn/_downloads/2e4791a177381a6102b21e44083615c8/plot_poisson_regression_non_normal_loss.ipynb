Available\nfeatures include driver age, vehicle age, vehicle power, etc.\n\nOur goal is to predict the expected frequency of claims following car accidents\nfor a new policyholder given the historical data over a population of\npolicyholders.\n\n..

        "As expected, the dummy regressor is unable to correctly rank the samples and\ntherefore performs the worst on this plot.\n\nThe tree-based model is significantly better at ranking policyholders by risk\nwhile the two linear models perform similarly.\n\nAll three models are significantly better than chance but also very far from\nmaking perfect predictions.\n\nThis last point is expected due to the nature of the problem: the occurrence\nof accidents is mostly dominated by circumstantial causes that are not\ncaptured in the columns of the dataset and can indeed be considered as purely\nrandom.\n\nThe linear models assume no interactions between the input variables which\nlikely causes under-fitting. Inserting a polynomial feature extractor\n(:func:`~sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures`) indeed increases their\ndiscrimative power by 2 points of Gini index. In particular it improves the\nability of the models to identify the top 5% riskiest profiles.\n\n## Main takeaways\n\n- The performance of the models can be evaluated by their ability to yield\n  well-calibrated predictions and a good ranking.\n\n- The calibration of the model can be assessed by plotting the mean observed\n  value vs the mean predicted value on groups of test samples binned by\n  predicted risk.\n\n- The least squares loss (along with the implicit use of the identity link\n  function) of the Ridge regression model seems to cause this model to be\n  badly calibrated. In particular, it tends to underestimate the risk and can\n  even predict invalid negative frequencies.\n\n- Using the Poisson loss with a log-link can correct these problems and lead\n  to a well-calibrated linear model.\n\n- The Gini index reflects the ability of a model to rank predictions\n  irrespective of their absolute values, and therefore only assess their\n  ranking power.\n\n- Despite the improvement in calibration, the ranking power of both linear\n  models are comparable and well below the ranking power of the Gradient\n  Boosting Regression Trees.\n\n- The Poisson deviance computed as an evaluation metric reflects both the\n  calibration and the ranking power of the model. It also makes a linear\n  assumption on the ideal relationship between the expected value and the\n  variance of the response variable. For the sake of conciseness we did not\n  check whether this assumption holds.\n\n- Traditional regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute\n  Error are hard to meaningfully interpret on count values with many zeros.\n\n"
