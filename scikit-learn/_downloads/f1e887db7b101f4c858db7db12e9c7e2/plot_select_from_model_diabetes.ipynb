The procedure is repeated until we reach the desired number of\nselected features.\n\nWe can also go in the reverse direction (backward SFS), *i.e.* start with all\nthe features and greedily choose features to remove one by one.

        "Interestingly, forward and backward selection have selected the same set of\nfeatures. In general, this isn't the case and the two methods would lead to\ndifferent results.\n\nWe also note that the features selected by SFS differ from those selected by\nfeature importance: SFS selects `bmi` instead of `s1`. This does sound\nreasonable though, since `bmi` corresponds to the third most important\nfeature according to the coefficients. It is quite remarkable considering\nthat SFS makes no use of the coefficients at all.\n\nTo finish with, we should note that\n:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` is significantly faster\nthan SFS. Indeed, :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` only\nneeds to fit a model once, while SFS needs to cross-validate many different\nmodels for each of the iterations. SFS however works with any model, while\n:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` requires the underlying\nestimator to expose a `coef_` attribute or a `feature_importances_`\nattribute. The forward SFS is faster than the backward SFS because it only\nneeds to perform `n_features_to_select = 2` iterations, while the backward\nSFS needs to perform `n_features - n_features_to_select = 8` iterations.\n\n## Using negative tolerance values\n\n:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector` can be used\nto remove features present in the dataset and return a\nsmaller subset of the original features with `direction=\"backward\"`\nand a negative value of `tol`.\n\nWe begin by loading the Breast Cancer dataset, consisting of 30 different\nfeatures and 569 samples.\n\n"
