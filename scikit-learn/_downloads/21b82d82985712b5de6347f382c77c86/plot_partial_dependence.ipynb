        "\n# Partial Dependence Plots\n\nPartial dependence plots show the dependence between the target function [2]_\nand a set of 'target' features, marginalizing over the values of all other\nfeatures (the complement features). Due to the limits of human perception, the\nsize of the target feature set must be small (usually, one or two) thus the\ntarget features are usually chosen among the most important features.\n\nThis example shows how to obtain partial dependence plots from a\n:class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` and a\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` trained on the\nCalifornia housing dataset. The example is taken from [1]_.\n\nThe plots show four 1-way and two 1-way partial dependence plots (omitted for\n:class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` due to computation time). The\ntarget variables for the one-way PDP are: median income (`MedInc`), average\noccupants per household (`AvgOccup`), median house age (`HouseAge`), and\naverage rooms per household (`AveRooms`).\n\n..

[2] For classification you can think of it as the regression score before\n       the link function.\n"

        "## Analysis of the plots\n\nWe can clearly see that the median house price shows a linear relationship\nwith the median income (top left) and that the house price drops when the\naverage occupants per household increases (top middle).\nThe top right plot shows that the house age in a district does not have\na strong influence on the (median) house price; so does the average rooms\nper household.\nThe tick marks on the x-axis represent the deciles of the feature values\nin the training data.\n\nWe also observe that :class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` has much\nsmoother predictions than\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`. For the plots to be\ncomparable, it is necessary to subtract the average value of the target\n``y``: The 'recursion' method, used by default for\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`, does not account\nfor the initial predictor (in our case the average target). Setting the\ntarget average to 0 avoids this bias.\n\nPartial dependence plots with two target features enable us to visualize\ninteractions among them. The two-way partial dependence plot shows the\ndependence of median house price on joint values of house age and average\noccupants per household. We can clearly see an interaction between the\ntwo features: for an average occupancy greater than two, the house price is\nnearly independent of the house age, whereas for values less than two there\nis a strong dependence on age.\n\n"
