        "\n# Plot classification boundaries with different SVM Kernels\nThis example shows how different kernels in a :class:`~sklearn.svm.SVC` (Support Vector\nClassifier) influence the classification boundaries in a binary, two-dimensional\nclassification problem.\n\nSVCs aim to find a hyperplane that effectively separates the classes in their training\ndata by maximizing the margin between the outermost data points of each class. This is\nachieved by finding the best weight vector $w$ that defines the decision boundary\nhyperplane and minimizes the sum of hinge losses for misclassified samples, as measured\nby the :func:`~sklearn.metrics.hinge_loss` function. By default, regularization is\napplied with the parameter `C=1`, which allows for a certain degree of misclassification\ntolerance.\n\nIf the data is not linearly separable in the original feature space, a non-linear kernel\nparameter can be set. Depending on the kernel, the process involves adding new features\nor transforming existing features to enrich and potentially add meaning to the data.\nWhen a kernel other than `\"linear\"` is set, the SVC applies the [kernel trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method#Mathematics:_the_kernel_trick)_, which\ncomputes the similarity between pairs of data points using the kernel function without\nexplicitly transforming the entire dataset. The kernel trick surpasses the otherwise\nnecessary matrix transformation of the whole dataset by only considering the relations\nbetween all pairs of data points. The kernel function maps two vectors (each pair of\nobservations) to their similarity using their dot product.\n\nThe hyperplane can then be calculated using the kernel function as if the dataset were\nrepresented in a higher-dimensional space. Using a kernel function instead of an\nexplicit matrix transformation improves performance, as the kernel function has a time\ncomplexity of $O({n}^2)$, whereas matrix transformation scales according to the\nspecific transformation being applied.\n\nIn this example, we compare the most common kernel types of Support Vector Machines: the\nlinear kernel (`\"linear\"`), the polynomial kernel (`\"poly\"`), the radial basis function\nkernel (`\"rbf\"`) and the sigmoid kernel (`\"sigmoid\"`).\n"
