        "\n# Approximate nearest neighbors in TSNE\n\nThis example presents how to chain KNeighborsTransformer and TSNE in a pipeline.\nIt also shows how to wrap the packages `nmslib` and `pynndescent` to replace\nKNeighborsTransformer and perform approximate nearest neighbors. These packages\ncan be installed with `pip install nmslib pynndescent`.\n\nNote: In KNeighborsTransformer we use the definition which includes each\ntraining point as its own neighbor in the count of `n_neighbors`, and for\ncompatibility reasons, one extra neighbor is computed when `mode == 'distance'`.\nPlease note that we do the same in the proposed `nmslib` wrapper.\n"

The approximate `NMSlibTransformer` is already\nslightly faster than the exact search on the smallest dataset but this speed\ndifference is expected to become more significant on datasets with a larger\nnumber of samples.\n\nNotice however that not all approximate search methods are guaranteed to\nimprove the speed of the default exact search method: indeed the exact search\nimplementation significantly improved since scikit-learn 1.1. Furthermore, the\nbrute-force exact search method does not require building an index at `fit`\ntime. So, to get an overall performance improvement in the context of the\n:class:`~sklearn.manifold.TSNE` pipeline, the gains of the approximate search\nat `transform` need to be larger than the extra time spent to build the\napproximate search index at `fit` time.\n\nFinally, the TSNE algorithm itself is also computationally intensive,\nirrespective of the nearest neighbors search. So speeding-up the nearest\nneighbors search step by a factor of 5 would not result in a speed up by a\nfactor of 5 for the overall pipeline.\n\n"
