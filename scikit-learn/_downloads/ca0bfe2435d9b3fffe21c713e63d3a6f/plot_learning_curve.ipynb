        "\n# Plotting Learning Curves\nIn the first column, first row the learning curve of a naive Bayes classifier\nis shown for the digits dataset. Note that the training score and the\ncross-validation score are both not very good at the end. However, the shape\nof the curve can be found in more complex datasets very often: the training\nscore is very high at the beginning and decreases and the cross-validation\nscore is very low at the beginning and increases. In the second column, first\nrow we see the learning curve of an SVM with RBF kernel. We can see clearly\nthat the training score is still around the maximum and the validation score\ncould be increased with more training samples. The plots in the second row\nshow the times required by the models to train with various sizes of training\ndataset. The plots in the third row show how much time was required to train\nthe models for each training sizes.\n"
