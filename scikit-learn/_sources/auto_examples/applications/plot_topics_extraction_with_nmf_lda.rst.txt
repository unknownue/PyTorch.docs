=======================================================================================
Topic extraction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
=======================================================================================

This is an example of applying :class:`sklearn.decomposition.NMF` and
:class:`sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation` on a corpus
of documents and extract additive models of the topic structure of the
corpus.  The output is a list of topics, each represented as a list of
terms (weights are not shown).

Non-negative Matrix Factorization is applied with two different objective
functions: the Frobenius norm, and the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence.
The latter is equivalent to Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing.

The default parameters (n_samples / n_features / n_components) should make
the example runnable in a couple of tens of seconds. You can try to
increase the dimensions of the problem, but be aware that the time
complexity is polynomial in NMF. In LDA, the time complexity is
proportional to (n_samples * iterations).
