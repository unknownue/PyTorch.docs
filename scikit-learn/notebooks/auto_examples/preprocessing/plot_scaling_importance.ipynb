        "\n# Importance of Feature Scaling\n\nFeature scaling through standardization, also called Z-score normalization, is\nan important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. It\ninvolves rescaling each feature such that it has a standard deviation of 1 and a\nmean of 0.\n\nEven if tree based models are (almost) not affected by scaling, many other\nalgorithms require features to be normalized, often for different reasons: to\nease the convergence (such as a non-penalized logistic regression), to create a\ncompletely different model fit compared to the fit with unscaled data (such as\nKNeighbors models). The latter is demoed on the first part of the present\nexample.\n\nOn the second part of the example we show how Principle Component Analysis (PCA)\nis impacted by normalization of features. To illustrate this, we compare the\nprincipal components found using :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA` on unscaled\ndata with those obatined when using a\n:class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` to scale data first.\n\nIn the last part of the example we show the effect of the normalization on the\naccuracy of a model trained on PCA-reduced data.\n"
