        "\n# Multi-class AdaBoosted Decision Trees\n\nThis example shows how boosting can improve the prediction accuracy on a\nmulti-label classification problem. It reproduces a similar experiment as\ndepicted by Figure 1 in Zhu et al [1]_.\n\nThe core principle of AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is to fit a sequence of weak\nlearners (e.g. Decision Trees) on repeatedly re-sampled versions of the data.\nEach sample carries a weight that is adjusted after each training step, such\nthat misclassified samples will be assigned higher weights. The re-sampling\nprocess with replacement takes into account the weights assigned to each sample.\nSamples with higher weights have a greater chance of being selected multiple\ntimes in the new data set, while samples with lower weights are less likely to\nbe selected. This ensures that subsequent iterations of the algorithm focus on\nthe difficult-to-classify samples.\n\n.. topic:: References:\n\n    .. [1] :doi:`J. Zhu, H. Zou, S. Rosset, T.

On the right plot, we show\nthe weights associated with each weak learner later used to make the\npredictions of the final additive model.\n\nWe see that the error of the weak learner is the inverse of the weights. It\nmeans that our additive model will trust more a weak learner that makes\nsmaller errors (on the training set) by increasing its impact on the final\ndecision. Indeed, this exactly is the formulation of updating the base\nestimators' weights after each iteration in AdaBoost.\n\n|details-start| Mathematical details |details-split|\n\nThe weight associated with a weak learner trained at the stage $m$ is\ninversely associated with its misclassification error such that:\n\n\\begin{align}\\alpha^{(m)} = \\log \\frac{1 - err^{(m)}}{err^{(m)}} + \\log (K - 1),\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\alpha^{(m)}$ and $err^{(m)}$ are the weight and the error\nof the $m$ th weak learner, respectively, and $K$ is the number of\nclasses in our classification problem. |details-end|\n\nAnother interesting observation boils down to the fact that the first weak\nlearners of the model make fewer errors than later weak learners of the\nboosting chain.\n\nThe intuition behind this observation is the following: due to the sample\nreweighting, later classifiers are forced to try to classify more difficult or\nnoisy samples and to ignore already well classified samples. Therefore, the\noverall error on the training set will increase. That's why the weak learner's\nweights are built to counter-balance the worse performing weak learners.\n\n"
