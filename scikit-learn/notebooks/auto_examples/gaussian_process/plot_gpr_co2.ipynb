        "\n# Forecasting of CO2 level on Mona Loa dataset using Gaussian process regression (GPR)\n\nThis example is based on Section 5.4.3 of \"Gaussian Processes for Machine\nLearning\" [RW2006]_. It illustrates an example of complex kernel engineering\nand hyperparameter optimization using gradient ascent on the\nlog-marginal-likelihood. The data consists of the monthly average atmospheric\nCO2 concentrations (in parts per million by volume (ppm)) collected at the\nMauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, between 1958 and 2001. The objective is to\nmodel the CO2 concentration as a function of the time $t$ and extrapolate\nfor years after 2001.\n\n.. topic: References\n\n    ..
