For such purpose, the\nmetrics are computed with a fixed number of samples and as a function of the number\nof clusters assigned by the estimator. The example is divided into two\nexperiments:\n\n- a first experiment with fixed \"ground truth labels\" (and therefore fixed\n  number of classes) and randomly \"predicted labels\";\n- a second experiment with varying \"ground truth labels\", randomly \"predicted\n  labels\".

        "## Defining the list of metrics to evaluate\n\nClustering algorithms are fundamentally unsupervised learning methods.\nHowever, since we assign class labels for the synthetic clusters in this\nexample, it is possible to use evaluation metrics that leverage this\n\"supervised\" ground truth information to quantify the quality of the resulting\nclusters. Examples of such metrics are the following:\n\n- V-measure, the harmonic mean of completeness and homogeneity;\n\n- Rand index, which measures how frequently pairs of data points are grouped\n  consistently according to the result of the clustering algorithm and the\n  ground truth class assignment;\n\n- Adjusted Rand index (ARI), a chance-adjusted Rand index such that a random\n  cluster assignment has an ARI of 0.0 in expectation;\n\n- Mutual Information (MI) is an information theoretic measure that quantifies\n  how dependent are the two labelings. Note that the maximum value of MI for\n  perfect labelings depends on the number of clusters and samples;\n\n- Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), a Mutual Information defined between 0\n  (no mutual information) in the limit of large number of data points and 1\n  (perfectly matching label assignments, up to a permutation of the labels).\n  It is not adjusted for chance: then the number of clustered data points is\n  not large enough, the expected values of MI or NMI for random labelings can\n  be significantly non-zero;\n\n- Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), a chance-adjusted Mutual Information.\n  Similarly to ARI, random cluster assignment has an AMI of 0.0 in\n  expectation.\n\nFor more information, see the `clustering_evaluation` module.\n\n"
