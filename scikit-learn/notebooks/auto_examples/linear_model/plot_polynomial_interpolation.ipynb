        "\n# Polynomial and Spline interpolation\n\nThis example demonstrates how to approximate a function with polynomials up to\ndegree ``degree`` by using ridge regression. We show two different ways given\n``n_samples`` of 1d points ``x_i``:\n\n- :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures` generates all monomials\n  up to ``degree``. This gives us the so called Vandermonde matrix with\n  ``n_samples`` rows and ``degree + 1`` columns::\n\n    [[1, x_0, x_0 ** 2, x_0 ** 3, ..., x_0 ** degree],\n     [1, x_1, x_1 ** 2, x_1 ** 3, ..., x_1 ** degree],\n     ...]\n\n  Intuitively, this matrix can be interpreted as a matrix of pseudo features\n  (the points raised to some power). The matrix is akin to (but different from)\n  the matrix induced by a polynomial kernel.\n\n- :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.SplineTransformer` generates B-spline basis\n  functions. A basis function of a B-spline is a piece-wise polynomial function\n  of degree ``degree`` that is non-zero only between ``degree+1`` consecutive\n  knots. Given ``n_knots`` number of knots, this results in matrix of\n  ``n_samples`` rows and ``n_knots + degree - 1`` columns::\n\n    [[basis_1(x_0), basis_2(x_0), ...],\n     [basis_1(x_1), basis_2(x_1), ...],\n     ...]\n\nThis example shows that these two transformers are well suited to model\nnon-linear effects with a linear model, using a pipeline to add non-linear\nfeatures. Kernel methods extend this idea and can induce very high (even\ninfinite) dimensional feature spaces.\n"

        "This shows nicely that higher degree polynomials can fit the data better. But\nat the same time, too high powers can show unwanted oscillatory behaviour\nand are particularly dangerous for extrapolation beyond the range of fitted\ndata. This is an advantage of B-splines. They usually fit the data as well as\npolynomials and show very nice and smooth behaviour. They have also good\noptions to control the extrapolation, which defaults to continue with a\nconstant. Note that most often, you would rather increase the number of knots\nbut keep ``degree=3``.\n\nIn order to give more insights into the generated feature bases, we plot all\ncolumns of both transformers separately.\n\n"

        "## Periodic Splines\nIn the previous example we saw the limitations of polynomials and splines for\nextrapolation beyond the range of the training observations. In some\nsettings, e.g. with seasonal effects, we expect a periodic continuation of\nthe underlying signal. Such effects can be modelled using periodic splines,\nwhich have equal function value and equal derivatives at the first and last\nknot. In the following case we show how periodic splines provide a better fit\nboth within and outside of the range of training data given the additional\ninformation of periodicity. The splines period is the distance between\nthe first and last knot, which we specify manually.\n\nPeriodic splines can also be useful for naturally periodic features (such as\nday of the year), as the smoothness at the boundary knots prevents a jump in\nthe transformed values (e.g. from Dec 31st to Jan 1st). For such naturally\nperiodic features or more generally features where the period is known, it is\nadvised to explicitly pass this information to the `SplineTransformer` by\nsetting the knots manually.\n\n"
