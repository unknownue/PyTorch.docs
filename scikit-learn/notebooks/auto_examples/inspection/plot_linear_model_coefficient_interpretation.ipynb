        "\n# Common pitfalls in interpretation of coefficients of linear models\n\nIn linear models, the target value is modeled as\na linear combination of the features (see the `linear_model` User Guide\nsection for a description of a set of linear models available in\nscikit-learn).\nCoefficients in multiple linear models represent the relationship between the\ngiven feature, $X_i$ and the target, $y$, assuming that all the\nother features remain constant (`conditional dependence\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_dependence>`_).\nThis is different from plotting $X_i$ versus $y$ and fitting a\nlinear relationship: in that case all possible values of the other features are\ntaken into account in the estimation (marginal dependence).\n\nThis example will provide some hints in interpreting coefficient in linear\nmodels, pointing at problems that arise when either the linear model is not\nappropriate to describe the dataset, or when features are correlated.\n\nWe will use data from the `\"Current Population Survey\"\n<https://www.openml.org/d/534>`_ from 1985 to predict\nwage as a function of various features such as experience, age, or education.\n   :depth: 1\n"
