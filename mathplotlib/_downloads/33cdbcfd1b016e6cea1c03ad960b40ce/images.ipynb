It is a most excellent enhancement to the\nstandard Python prompt, and it ties in especially well with\nMatplotlib.  Start IPython either directly at a shell, or with the Jupyter\nNotebook (where IPython as a running kernel).\n\nWith IPython started, we now need to connect to a GUI event loop.  This\ntells IPython where (and how) to display plots.  To connect to a GUI\nloop, execute the **%matplotlib** magic at your IPython prompt.  There's more\ndetail on exactly what this does at [IPython's documentation on GUI\nevent loops](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/reference.html#gui-event-loop-support).\n\nIf you're using Jupyter Notebook, the same commands are available, but\npeople commonly use a specific argument to the %matplotlib magic:\n\n.. sourcecode:: ipython\n\n    In [1]: %matplotlib inline\n\nThis turns on inline plotting, where plot graphics will appear in your\nnotebook.  This has important implications for interactivity.  For inline plotting, commands in\ncells below the cell that outputs a plot will not affect the plot.  For example,\nchanging the colormap is not possible from cells below the cell that creates a plot.\nHowever, for other backends, such as Qt, that open a separate window,\ncells below those that create the plot will change the plot - it is a\nlive object in memory.\n\nThis tutorial will use Matplotlib's implicit plotting interface, pyplot.  This\ninterface maintains global state, and is very useful for quickly and easily\nexperimenting with various plot settings.  The alternative is the explicit,\nwhich is more suitable for large application development.  For an explanation\nof the tradeoffs between the implicit and explicit interfaces see\n`api_interfaces` and the `Quick start guide\n<quick_start>` to start using the explicit interface.\nFor now, let's get on with the implicit approach:\n"

Depending\non where you get your data, the other kinds of image that you'll most\nlikely encounter are RGBA images, which allow for transparency, or\nsingle-channel grayscale (luminosity) images.  Download [stinkbug.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/main/doc/_static/stinkbug.png)\nto your computer for the rest of this tutorial.\n\nWe use Pillow to open an image (with `PIL.Image.open`), and immediately\nconvert the `PIL.Image.Image` object into an 8-bit (``dtype=uint8``) numpy\narray.\n\n"

An RGBA (where A is alpha, or transparency) has 4 values\nper inner list, and a simple luminance image just has one value (and\nis thus only a 2-D array, not a 3-D array).  For RGB and RGBA images,\nMatplotlib supports float32 and uint8 data types.  For grayscale,\nMatplotlib supports only float32.  If your array data does not meet\none of these descriptions, you need to rescale it.\n\n\n## Plotting numpy arrays as images\n\nSo, you have your data in a numpy array (either by importing it, or by\ngenerating it).  Let's render it.  In Matplotlib, this is performed\nusing the :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` function.  Here we'll grab\nthe plot object.  This object gives you an easy way to manipulate the\nplot from the prompt.\n\n"

We currently have an RGB image.  Since R, G, and B are all\nsimilar (see for yourself above or in your data), we can just pick one\nchannel of our data using array slicing (you can read more in the\n[Numpy tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html\n#indexing-slicing-and-iterating)):\n\n"

        "\n### Array Interpolation schemes\n\nInterpolation calculates what the color or value of a pixel \"should\"\nbe, according to different mathematical schemes.  One common place\nthat this happens is when you resize an image.  The number of pixels\nchange, but you want the same information.  Since pixels are discrete,\nthere's missing space.  Interpolation is how you fill that space.\nThis is why your images sometimes come out looking pixelated when you\nblow them up.  The effect is more pronounced when the difference\nbetween the original image and the expanded image is greater.  Let's\ntake our image and shrink it.  We're effectively discarding pixels,\nonly keeping a select few.  Now when we plot it, that data gets blown\nup to the size on your screen.  The old pixels aren't there anymore,\nand the computer has to draw in pixels to fill that space.\n\nWe'll use the Pillow library that we used to load the image also to resize\nthe image.\n\n"
