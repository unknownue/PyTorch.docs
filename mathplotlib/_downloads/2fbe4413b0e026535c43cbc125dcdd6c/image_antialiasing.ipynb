        "\n# Image antialiasing\n\nImages are represented by discrete pixels, either on the screen or in an\nimage file.  When data that makes up the image has a different resolution\nthan its representation on the screen we will see aliasing effects.  How\nnoticeable these are depends on how much down-sampling takes place in\nthe change of resolution (if any).\n\nWhen subsampling data, aliasing is reduced by smoothing first and then\nsubsampling the smoothed data.  In Matplotlib, we can do that\nsmoothing before mapping the data to colors, or we can do the smoothing\non the RGB(A) data in the final image.  The differences between these are\nshown below, and controlled with the *interpolation_stage* keyword argument.\n\nThe default image interpolation in Matplotlib is 'antialiased', and\nit is applied to the data.  This uses a\nhanning interpolation on the data provided by the user for reduced aliasing\nin most situations. Only when there is upsampling by a factor of 1, 2 or\n>=3 is 'nearest' neighbor interpolation used.\n\nOther anti-aliasing filters can be specified in `.Axes.imshow` using the\n*interpolation* keyword argument.\n"

The 'antialiased' imaged\nstill has some Moir\u00e9 patterns as well, but they are greatly reduced.\n\nThere are substantial differences between the 'data' interpolation and\nthe 'rgba' interpolation.  The alternating bands of red and blue on the\nleft third of the image are subsampled.
