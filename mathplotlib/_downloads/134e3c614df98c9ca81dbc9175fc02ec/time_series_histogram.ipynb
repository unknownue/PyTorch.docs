        "\n# Time Series Histogram\n\nThis example demonstrates how to efficiently visualize large numbers of time\nseries in a way that could potentially reveal hidden substructure and patterns\nthat are not immediately obvious, and display them in a visually appealing way.\n\nIn this example, we generate multiple sinusoidal \"signal\" series that are\nburied under a larger number of random walk \"noise/background\" series. For an\nunbiased Gaussian random walk with standard deviation of \u03c3, the RMS deviation\nfrom the origin after n steps is \u03c3*sqrt(n). So in order to keep the sinusoids\nvisible on the same scale as the random walks, we scale the amplitude by the\nrandom walk RMS. In addition, we also introduce a small random offset ``phi``\nto shift the sines left/right, and some additive random noise to shift\nindividual data points up/down to make the signal a bit more \"realistic\" (you\nwouldn't expect a perfect sine wave to appear in your data).\n\nThe first plot shows the typical way of visualizing multiple time series by\noverlaying them on top of each other with ``plt.plot`` and a small value of\n``alpha``. The second and third plots show how to reinterpret the data as a 2d\nhistogram, with optional interpolation between data points, by using\n``np.histogram2d`` and ``plt.pcolormesh``.\n"
