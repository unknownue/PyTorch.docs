=======
3D stem

Demonstration of a stem plot in 3D, which plots vertical lines from a baseline
to the *z*-coordinate and places a marker at the tip.

The position of the baseline can be adapted using *bottom*. The parameters
*linefmt*, *markerfmt*, and *basefmt* control basic format properties of the
plot. However, in contrast to `~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot` not all properties are
configurable via keyword arguments. For more advanced control adapt the line
objects returned by `~mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.stem`.

The orientation of the stems and baseline can be changed using *orientation*.
This determines in which direction the stems are projected from the head
points, towards the *bottom* baseline.

For examples, by setting ``orientation='x'``, the stems are projected along
the *x*-direction, and the baseline is in the *yz*-plane.
