===========================
Centered spines with arrows
===========================

This example shows a way to draw a "math textbook" style plot, where the
spines ("axes lines") are drawn at ``x = 0`` and ``y = 0``, and have arrows at
their ends.

    # Hide the top and right spines.
    ax.spines[["top", "right"]].set_visible(False)

    # Draw arrows (as black triangles: ">k"/"^k") at the end of the axes.  In each
    # case, one of the coordinates (0) is a data coordinate (i.e., y = 0 or x = 0,
    # respectively) and the other one (1) is an axes coordinate (i.e., at the very
    # right/top of the axes).  Also, disable clipping (clip_on=False) as the marker
    # actually spills out of the axes.
    ax.plot(1, 0, ">k", transform=ax.get_yaxis_transform(), clip_on=False)
    ax.plot(0, 1, "^k", transform=ax.get_xaxis_transform(), clip_on=False)

    # Some sample data.
    x = np.linspace(-0.5, 1., 100)
    ax.plot(x, np.sin(x*np.pi))
