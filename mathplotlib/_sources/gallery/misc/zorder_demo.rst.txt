===========
Zorder Demo
===========

The drawing order of artists is determined by their ``zorder`` attribute, which
is a floating point number. Artists with higher ``zorder`` are drawn on top.
You can change the order for individual artists by setting their ``zorder``.
The default value depends on the type of the Artist:

================================================================    =======
Artist                                                              Z-order
================================================================    =======
Images (`.AxesImage`, `.FigureImage`, `.BboxImage`)                 0
`.Patch`, `.PatchCollection`                                        1
`.Line2D`, `.LineCollection` (including minor ticks, grid lines)    2
Major ticks                                                         2.01
`.Text` (including axes labels and titles)                          3
`.Legend`                                                           5
================================================================    =======

Any call to a plotting method can set a value for the zorder of that particular
item explicitly.

.. note::

   `~.axes.Axes.set_axisbelow` and :rc:`axes.axisbelow` are convenient helpers
   for setting the zorder of ticks and grid lines.

Drawing is done per `~.axes.Axes` at a time. If you have overlapping Axes, all
elements of the second Axes are drawn on top of the first Axes, irrespective of
their relative zorder.

The following example contains a `.Line2D` created by `~.axes.Axes.plot()`
and the dots (a `.PatchCollection`) created by `~.axes.Axes.scatter()`.
Hence, by default the dots are below the line (first subplot).
In the second subplot, the ``zorder`` is set explicitly to move the dots
on top of the line.

Many functions that create a visible object accepts a ``zorder`` parameter.
Alternatively, you can call ``set_zorder()`` on the created object later.
