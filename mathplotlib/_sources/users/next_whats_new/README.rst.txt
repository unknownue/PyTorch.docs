Instructions for writing "What's new" entries
=============================================

Please place new portions of `whats_new.rst` in the `next_whats_new` directory.

When adding an entry please look at the currently existing files to
see if you can extend any of them.  If you create a file, name it
something like :file:`cool_new_feature.rst` if you have added a brand new
feature or something like :file:`updated_feature.rst` for extensions of
existing features.

Please avoid using references in section titles, as it causes links to be
confusing in the table of contents.  Instead, ensure that a reference is
included in the descriptive text.  Include contents of the form: ::

    Section title for feature
    -------------------------

    A bunch of text about how awesome the new feature is and examples of how
    to use it.

    A sub-section
