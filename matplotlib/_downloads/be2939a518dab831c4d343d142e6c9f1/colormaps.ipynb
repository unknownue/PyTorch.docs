        "\n********************************\nChoosing Colormaps in Matplotlib\n********************************\n\nMatplotlib has a number of built-in colormaps accessible via\n`.matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`.  There are also external libraries like\n[palettable]_ and [colorcet]_ that have many extra colormaps.\nHere we briefly discuss how to choose between the many options.  For\nhelp on creating your own colormaps, see\n:doc:`/tutorials/colors/colormap-manipulation`.\n\nOverview\n========\n\nThe idea behind choosing a good colormap is to find a good representation in 3D\ncolorspace for your data set. The best colormap for any given data set depends\non many things including:\n\n- Whether representing form or metric data ([Ware]_)\n\n- Your knowledge of the data set (*e.g.*, is there a critical value\n  from which the other values deviate?)\n\n- If there is an intuitive color scheme for the parameter you are plotting\n\n- If there is a standard in the field the audience may be expecting\n\nFor many applications, a perceptually uniform colormap is the best choice;\ni.e. a colormap in which equal steps in data are perceived as equal\nsteps in the color space. Researchers have found that the human brain\nperceives changes in the lightness parameter as changes in the data\nmuch better than, for example, changes in hue. Therefore, colormaps\nwhich have monotonically increasing lightness through the colormap\nwill be better interpreted by the viewer. A wonderful example of\nperceptually uniform colormaps is [colorcet]_.\n\nColor can be represented in 3D space in various ways. One way to represent color\nis using CIELAB. In CIELAB, color space is represented by lightness,\n$L^*$; red-green, $a^*$; and yellow-blue, $b^*$. The lightness\nparameter $L^*$ can then be used to learn more about how the matplotlib\ncolormaps will be perceived by viewers.\n\nAn excellent starting resource for learning about human perception of colormaps\nis from [IBM]_.\n\n\nClasses of colormaps\n====================\n\nColormaps are often split into several categories based on their function (see,\n*e.g.*, [Moreland]_):\n\n1. Sequential: change in lightness and often saturation of color\n   incrementally, often using a single hue; should be used for\n   representing information that has ordering.\n\n2. Diverging: change in lightness and possibly saturation of two\n   different colors that meet in the middle at an unsaturated color;\n   should be used when the information being plotted has a critical\n   middle value, such as topography or when the data deviates around\n   zero.\n\n3. Cyclic: change in lightness of two different colors that meet in\n   the middle and beginning/end at an unsaturated color; should be\n   used for values that wrap around at the endpoints, such as phase\n   angle, wind direction, or time of day.\n\n4. Qualitative: often are miscellaneous colors; should be used to\n   represent information which does not have ordering or\n   relationships.\n"

        "Grayscale conversion\n====================\n\nIt is important to pay attention to conversion to grayscale for color\nplots, since they may be printed on black and white printers.  If not\ncarefully considered, your readers may end up with indecipherable\nplots because the grayscale changes unpredictably through the\ncolormap.\n\nConversion to grayscale is done in many different ways [bw]_. Some of the\nbetter ones use a linear combination of the rgb values of a pixel, but\nweighted according to how we perceive color intensity. A nonlinear method of\nconversion to grayscale is to use the $L^*$ values of the pixels. In\ngeneral, similar principles apply for this question as they do for presenting\none's information perceptually; that is, if a colormap is chosen that is\nmonotonically increasing in $L^*$ values, it will print in a reasonable\nmanner to grayscale.\n\nWith this in mind, we see that the Sequential colormaps have reasonable\nrepresentations in grayscale. Some of the Sequential2 colormaps have decent\nenough grayscale representations, though some (autumn, spring, summer,\nwinter) have very little grayscale change. If a colormap like this was used\nin a plot and then the plot was printed to grayscale, a lot of the\ninformation may map to the same gray values. The Diverging colormaps mostly\nvary from darker gray on the outer edges to white in the middle. Some\n(PuOr and seismic) have noticeably darker gray on one side than the other\nand therefore are not very symmetric. coolwarm has little range of gray scale\nand would print to a more uniform plot, losing a lot of detail. Note that\noverlaid, labeled contours could help differentiate between one side of the\ncolormap vs. the other since color cannot be used once a plot is printed to\ngrayscale. Many of the Qualitative and Miscellaneous colormaps, such as\nAccent, hsv, jet and turbo, change from darker to lighter and back to darker\ngrey throughout the colormap. This would make it impossible for a viewer to\ninterpret the information in a plot once it is printed in grayscale.\n\n"
