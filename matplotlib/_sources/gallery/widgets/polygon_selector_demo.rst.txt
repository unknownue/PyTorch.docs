 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Select points in the figure by enclosing them within a polygon.
    Press the 'esc' key to start a new polygon.
    Try holding the 'shift' key to move all of the vertices.
    Try holding the 'ctrl' key to move a single vertex.

    Selected points:
    []

    class SelectFromCollection:
        """
        Select indices from a matplotlib collection using `PolygonSelector`.

        Selected indices are saved in the `ind` attribute. This tool fades out the
        points that are not part of the selection (i.e., reduces their alpha
        values). If your collection has alpha < 1, this tool will permanently
        alter the alpha values.

        Note that this tool selects collection objects based on their *origins*
        (i.e., `offsets`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        ax : `~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
            Axes to interact with.
        collection : `matplotlib.collections.Collection` subclass
            Collection you want to select from.
        alpha_other : 0 <= float <= 1
            To highlight a selection, this tool sets all selected points to an
            alpha value of 1 and non-selected points to *alpha_other*.
