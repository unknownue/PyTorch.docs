==================
Image antialiasing
==================

Images are represented by discrete pixels, either on the screen or in an
image file.  When data that makes up the image has a different resolution
than its representation on the screen we will see aliasing effects.

The default image interpolation in Matplotlib is 'antialiased'.  This uses a
hanning interpolation for reduced aliasing in most situations. Only when there
is upsampling by a factor of 1, 2 or >=3 is 'nearest' neighbor interpolation
used.

Other anti-aliasing filters can be specified in `.Axes.imshow` using the
*interpolation* keyword argument.


.. code-block:: default


    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt








First we generate a 500x500 px image with varying frequency content:


.. code-block:: default

    x = np.arange(500) / 500 - 0.5
    y = np.arange(500) / 500 - 0.5

    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
    f0 = 10
    k = 250
    a = np.sin(np.pi * 2 * (f0 * R + k * R**2 / 2))









The following images are subsampled from 500 data pixels to 303 rendered
pixels. The Moire patterns in the 'nearest' interpolation are caused by the
high-frequency data being subsampled.  The 'antialiased' image
still has some Moire patterns as well, but they are greatly reduced.


.. code-block:: default

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 4), constrained_layout=True)
    for ax, interp in zip(axs, ['nearest', 'antialiased']):
        ax.imshow(a, interpolation=interp, cmap='gray')
        ax.set_title(f"interpolation='{interp}'")
    plt.show()




.. image:: /gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_image_antialiasing_001.png
    :alt: interpolation='nearest', interpolation='antialiased'
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Even up-sampling an image with 'nearest' interpolation will lead to Moire
patterns when the upsampling factor is not integer. The following image
upsamples 500 data pixels to 530 rendered pixels. You may note a grid of
30 line-like artifacts which stem from the 524 - 500 = 24 extra pixels that
had to be made up. Since interpolation is 'nearest' they are the same as a
neighboring line of pixels and thus stretch the image locally so that it
looks distorted.


.. code-block:: default

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6.8, 6.8))
    ax.imshow(a, interpolation='nearest', cmap='gray')
    ax.set_title("upsampled by factor a 1.048, interpolation='nearest'")
    plt.show()




.. image:: /gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_image_antialiasing_002.png
    :alt: upsampled by factor a 1.048, interpolation='nearest'
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Better antialiasing algorithms can reduce this effect:


.. code-block:: default

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6.8, 6.8))
    ax.imshow(a, interpolation='antialiased', cmap='gray')
    ax.set_title("upsampled by factor a 1.048, interpolation='antialiased'")
    plt.show()




.. image:: /gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_image_antialiasing_003.png
    :alt: upsampled by factor a 1.048, interpolation='antialiased'
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Apart from the default 'hanning' antialiasing  `~.Axes.imshow` supports a
number of different interpolation algorithms, which may work better or
worse depending on the pattern.


.. code-block:: default

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 4), constrained_layout=True)
    for ax, interp in zip(axs, ['hanning', 'lanczos']):
        ax.imshow(a, interpolation=interp, cmap='gray')
        ax.set_title(f"interpolation='{interp}'")
    plt.show()





.. image:: /gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_image_antialiasing_004.png
    :alt: interpolation='hanning', interpolation='lanczos'
