        "## Just create a ``nn.Module`` and override the ``forward`` method\n\nIn most cases, this is all you're going to need, as long as you already know\nthe structure of the input that your transform will expect. For example if\nyou're just doing image classification, your transform will typically accept a\nsingle image as input, or a ``(img, label)`` input. So you can just hard-code\nyour ``forward`` method to accept just that, e.g.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class MyCustomTransform(torch.nn.Module):\n        def forward(self, img, label):\n            # Do some transformations\n            return new_img, new_label\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>This means that if you have a custom transform that is already compatible\n    with the V1 transforms (those in ``torchvision.transforms``), it will\n    still work with the V2 transforms without any change!</p></div>\n\nWe will illustrate this more completely below with a typical detection case,\nwhere our samples are just images, bounding boxes and labels:\n\n"

If you want your custom transforms to be as flexible as possible,\nthis can be a bit limiting.\n\nA key feature of the builtin Torchvision V2 transforms is that they can accept\narbitrary input structure and return the same structure as output (with\ntransformed entries). For example, transforms can accept a single image, or a\ntuple of ``(img, label)``, or an arbitrary nested dictionary as input:\n\n"

The (potentially transformed) entries are then repacked and\nreturned, in the same structure as the input.\n\nWe do not provide public dev-facing tools to achieve that at this time, but if\nthis is something that would be valuable to you, please let us know by opening\nan issue on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues).\n\n"
