# Visualizing a grid of images
# ----------------------------

# tensor that represents multiple images in a grid.  This util requires a single
# image of dtype ``uint8`` as input.

# Visualizing bounding boxes
# --------------------------
# We can use :func:`~torchvision.utils.draw_bounding_boxes` to draw boxes on an
# image. We can set the colors, labels, width as well as font and font size.
# The boxes are in ``(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`` format.

# Naturally, we can also plot bounding boxes produced by torchvision detection
# models.  Here is a demo with a Faster R-CNN model loaded from

# Visualizing segmentation masks

# segmentation models have different outputs, so we will treat each
# independently.

# Semantic segmentation models
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We will see how to use it with torchvision's FCN Resnet-50, loaded with
# :func:`~torchvision.models.segmentation.fcn_resnet50`. Let's start by looking
# at the output of the model.

print(output.shape, output.min().item(), output.max().item())

# %%
# As we can see above, the output of the segmentation model is a tensor of shape
# ``(batch_size, num_classes, H, W)``. Each value is a non-normalized score, and
# we can normalize them into ``[0, 1]`` by using a softmax. After the softmax,
# we can interpret each value as a probability indicating how likely a given
# pixel is to belong to a given class.
#
# Let's plot the masks that have been detected for the dog class and for the
# boat class:

sem_class_to_idx = {cls: idx for (idx, cls) in enumerate(weights.meta["categories"])}

normalized_masks = torch.nn.functional.softmax(output, dim=1)

dog_and_boat_masks = [
    normalized_masks[img_idx, sem_class_to_idx[cls]]

    for cls in ('dog', 'boat')
]

show(dog_and_boat_masks)

# %%
# As expected, the model is confident about the dog class, but not so much for
# the boat class.
#
# The :func:`~torchvision.utils.draw_segmentation_masks` function can be used to
# plots those masks on top of the original image. This function expects the
# masks to be boolean masks, but our masks above contain probabilities in ``[0,
# 1]``. To get boolean masks, we can do the following:

class_dim = 1
boolean_dog_masks = (normalized_masks.argmax(class_dim) == sem_class_to_idx['dog'])
print(f"shape = {boolean_dog_masks.shape}, dtype = {boolean_dog_masks.dtype}")
show([m.float() for m in boolean_dog_masks])


# %%
# The line above where we define ``boolean_dog_masks`` is a bit cryptic, but you
# can read it as the following query: "For which pixels is 'dog' the most likely
# class?"
#
# .. note::
#   While we're using the ``normalized_masks`` here, we would have
#   gotten the same result by using the non-normalized scores of the model
#   directly (as the softmax operation preserves the order).
#
# Now that we have boolean masks, we can use them with
# :func:`~torchvision.utils.draw_segmentation_masks` to plot them on top of the
# original images:

from torchvision.utils import draw_segmentation_masks

dogs_with_masks = [
    draw_segmentation_masks(img, masks=mask, alpha=0.7)

# %%
# We can plot more than one mask per image! Remember that the model returned as
# many masks as there are classes. Let's ask the same query as above, but this
# time for *all* classes, not just the dog class: "For each pixel and each class
# C, is class C the most likely class?"
#
# This one is a bit more involved, so we'll first show how to do it with a
# single image, and then we'll generalize to the batch

# background and the mask for the dog. This is because the model thinks that
# only these 2 classes are the most likely ones across all the pixels. If the
# model had detected another class as the most likely among other pixels, we
# would have seen its mask above.
#
# Removing the background mask is as simple as passing
# ``masks=dog1_all_classes_masks[1:]``, because the background class is the
# class with index 0.

# Let's now do the same but for an entire batch of images. The code is similar
# but involves a bit more juggling with the dimensions.

#
# Instance segmentation models
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Instance segmentation models have a significantly different output from the
# semantic segmentation models. We will see here how to plot the masks for such
# models. Let's start by analyzing the output of a Mask-RCNN model. Note that
# these models don't require the images to be normalized, so we don't need to
# use the normalized batch.
#
# .. note::
#
#     We will here describe the output of a Mask-RCNN model. The models in
#     :ref:`object_det_inst_seg_pers_keypoint_det` all have a similar output
#     format, but some of them may have extra info like keypoints for
#     :func:`~torchvision.models.detection.keypointrcnn_resnet50_fpn`, and some
#     of them may not have masks, like
#     :func:`~torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`.

# %%
# Let's break this down. For each image in the batch, the model outputs some
# detections (or instances). The number of detections varies for each input
# image. Each instance is described by its bounding box, its label, its score
# and its mask.
#
# The way the output is organized is as follows: the output is a list of length
# ``batch_size``. Each entry in the list corresponds to an input image, and it
# is a dict with keys 'boxes', 'labels', 'scores', and 'masks'. Each value
# associated to those keys has ``num_instances`` elements in it.  In our case
# above there are 3 instances detected in the first image, and 2 instances in
# the second one.
#
# The boxes can be plotted with :func:`~torchvision.utils.draw_bounding_boxes`
# as above, but here we're more interested in the masks. These masks are quite
# different from the masks that we saw above for the semantic segmentation
# models.

# Here the masks correspond to probabilities indicating, for each pixel, how
# likely it is to belong to the predicted label of that instance. Those
# predicted labels correspond to the 'labels' element in the same output dict.
# Let's see which labels were predicted for the instances of the first image.

# %%
# Interestingly, the model detects two persons in the image. Let's go ahead and
# plot those masks. Since :func:`~torchvision.utils.draw_segmentation_masks`
# expects boolean masks, we need to convert those probabilities into boolean
# values. Remember that the semantic of those masks is "How likely is this pixel
# to belong to the predicted class?". As a result, a natural way of converting
# those masks into boolean values is to threshold them with the 0.5 probability
# (one could also choose a different threshold).

# relevant masks:
